# Go AlgoChat Primitives

## Purpose

Provide the existing Go primitives for AlgoChat encryption, envelope encoding, signing, account derivation, message models, offline queues, and in-memory storage while the high-level client remains under development.

## Invariants

1. Message encryption accepts plaintext up to `MaxPayloadSize`, uses a fresh ephemeral X25519 key pair and nonce, authenticates ciphertext with ChaCha20-Poly1305, and permits the intended recipient or original sender to decrypt with the corresponding private key.
2. Envelope decoding accepts only the standard version-one protocol header and at least the fixed header plus authentication tag; it copies the remaining bytes as ciphertext and does not independently enforce the encryption-time plaintext limit.
3. Encryption-key signatures use Ed25519 with explicit public-key and signature length validation; both fingerprint helpers deterministically format the first eight SHA-256 bytes as four uppercase groups.
4. Account constructors derive the same X25519 key pair from the same 32-byte seed and split a 64-byte Algorand secret key into its seed and Ed25519 public-key halves.
5. Conversation, queue, and in-memory storage operations synchronize shared state and preserve their documented ordering, deduplication, capacity, retry, participant-isolation, missing-key, and expiry behavior.
6. The Go compatibility matrix and unified Trust gate remain independent blocking workflows, and this migration does not claim the unfinished high-level client is implemented.

## Behavioral Examples

```
Given two valid AlgoChat accounts and a plaintext within the protocol limit
When one account encrypts and encodes a message for the other
Then the recipient can decode and authenticate the original plaintext while an unrelated key cannot
```

## Error Cases

| Error | When | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| Invalid envelope | The note is too short or has an unsupported version or protocol ID | `DecodeEnvelope` returns an `ErrInvalidEnvelope`-wrapped error |
| Oversized message | Plaintext passed to encryption exceeds `MaxPayloadSize` | `EncryptMessage` returns an `ErrMessageTooLarge`-wrapped error |
| Wrong or tampered key material | Authenticated decryption cannot validate ciphertext or the encrypted sender key | Decryption returns an `ErrDecryptionFailed`-wrapped error |
| Invalid signature input | An Ed25519 key or signature has an unsupported length | Signing or verification returns the corresponding length error |
| Full queue | Enqueue would exceed the configured queue capacity | `Enqueue` returns `ErrQueueFull` |
| Missing stored key | A requested address has no private key | `Retrieve` returns `ErrKeyNotFound` |

- Go 1.25 or newer
